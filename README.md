# just-talking-text-chat
### A practical example of a simple text chat
Some details:
- this chat use only one database with the jsonbin api
- this has made to practice (and for fun), more technical concepts referring to online chats or databases will not be covered, at least not in this project
- the chat is refreshed every 5 secs
- keep the respect
- some things like check users names can be made better with two (or more) databases
- maybe some things grow up too much in resolutions greatter than 1366x768 (my res)
- fontawesome has used too send icon
